Let cool to room temperature and then refrigerate until very cold and firm (at least a couple of hours)."", ""Once the dulce de leche is nice and cold, you can go ahead and make the ganache: finely chop the chocolate and put in a heat resistant bowl. In a separate heat resistant bowl put the butter and the heavy cream, and bring to a boil in the microwave (check it often and only heat it until it boils but don't let it over-boil). Pour the hot heavy cream over the chopped chocolate and very slowly stir and mix until the chocolate is completely dissolved in the heavy cream and you have a nice and shiny chocolate ganache. Add the vanilla and stir. Let it sit for about 5 minutes before proceeding. Then pour the ganache over the shortbread and dulce de leche and - with a light hand - spread it all over (you do not want to overwork the ganache, otherwise it may lose its shine, and you definitely do not want the dulce de leche and the ganache to mix)."", ""Refrigerate for several hours until the ganache is completely set and hard (think truffle material).

Stir the dry ingredients together so that they are evenly distributed throughout the flour. Now, pour in the milk. Stir with a big spoon until you have a ball of dough that leaves the sides of the bowl. You may have to dust the ball of dough with a little flour if it seems sticky to you. Gently knead the ball of dough right there in the bowl 5 or 6 times. Now place your dough on the counter. You may use a piece of waxed paper under the dough if you like. Using a rolling pin roll out the dough to a rectangular shape. If the edges become uneven, use your hands to reshape into a rectangle. It doesn't have to be perfect. You are aiming for a rectangle that will fi into a 9- by 13-inch pan. When you get the dough the right size, set it aside."", ""Meanwhile, place the margarine in the 9- by 13-inch pan and place the pan in a 425F oven to melt the margarine. When the margarine is melted, carefully remove the pan from the oven, so as not to burn yourself. Sprinkle the second teaspoon of garlic powder and the 1/2 teaspoon of salt into the pan. You do not have to use the extra salt. Now, very carefully, lay your rectangle of dough into the pan, over top of the margarine. Next cut the rectangle into narrow strips. One method of doing this is to cut the dough in half, then cut each half again, quartering the dough, and then cut each quarter into narrow strips. The margarine will creep up between the strips. This is normal. It is what gives these bread sticks their texture. After cutting your strips, place the pan in the oven, still at 425F, and bake them for 20 minutes. They will be browned and crispy when they are done."", ""The parsley is simply for decoration. It makes the bread sticks look more gourmet, but it adds little to the flavor or the texture.
