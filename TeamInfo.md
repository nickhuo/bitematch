## Project Summary

 Deciding what to eat can be a time-consuming and frustrating experience, especially with the overwhelming number of recipes available online. Our preference-based dish decision-making app simplifies this process by offering a personalized and efficient way for users to discover meals that align with their dietary preferences, calorie goals, and ingredient availability. Unlike traditional cookbook and recipe management apps, our platform minimizes decision fatigue by streamlining the selection process.
 At its core, the app functions like a “dating app for recipes,” where users can quickly browse and express interest in meals by swiping to save, mark as a “maybe,” or skip. Over time, the app refines recommendations based on user preferences, creating a highly personalized experience. In this way, our application allows users to explore a diverse range of dishes in a short amount of time, making meal planning effortless and enjoyable.
